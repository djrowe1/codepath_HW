I used the Google Cloud Platform to setup a Virtual Machine for the MHN Admin. I downloaded the Google Cloud SDK Shell and followed the instructions for how to setup the firewall-rules list and how to setup the inbound ports for the MHN Admin. After creating the MHN Admin, I established a ssh connection and installed MHN Admin Application at port http://34.132.1.64.
